# AlphaPathMoves

On how to use please read the library documentation in Documentation\apm_documentation.pdf.

NOTE:
Currently, main.cpp tries to load some unit-tests. Unfortunately, those unit-tests can not be public. Simply, read the documentation and create your problem instances. Also, on Dec 18th we will release 2D illustrative examples showing how to use library.
