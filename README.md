# AlphaPathMoves

On how to use please read the library [documentation](Documentation/apm_documentation.pdf).

## NOTE:
Currently, main.cpp tries to load some 3D unit-tests (which requires VS2017). Unfortunately, those unit-tests can not be public. Nonetheless, If you are familiar with the [HINTS](http://www.hossamisack.com/pdfs/pathmoves_cvpr2017.pdf) segmentation model, [Hedgehog](http://www.hossamisack.com/pdfs/hedgehogs_cvpr2016.pdf) shape prior and read the documentation, you can easily build your HINTS instances and solve them using the AlphaPathMoves Library. Also, on Dec 18th we will release 2D illustrative examples showing how to use the library and VS2017 will no longer be a requirement.
