# AlphaPathMoves

On how to use please read the library documentation in Documentation\apm_documentation.pdf.

NOTE:
Currently, main.cpp tries to load some 3D unit-tests (which requires VS2017). Unfortunately, those unit-tests can not be public. Simply, read the documentation and create your problem instances. Also, on Dec 18th we will release 2D illustrative examples showing how to use library and VS2017 will no longer be a requirement.
